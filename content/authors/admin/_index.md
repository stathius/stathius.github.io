I am a PhD student at Imperial College London and a Research Scientist Intern at MediaTek Research UK. I apply my skills and knowledge in machine learning to develop novel generative models. My diverse background in physics, computer science and AI allows me to tackle problems from a multidisciplinary perspective. I have published multiple papers in top-tier conferences, including oral and spotlight presentations, and received awards and scholarships for my academic excellence and innovative ideas.

I have over five years of industry experience as a data scientist and a researcher, working with leading companies and institutions such as MediaTek, King, BBVA, Imperial College London, University of Edinburgh and Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.
